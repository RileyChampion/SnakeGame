So I want to make a snake like game using:
	-pygame
	-classes
	-Game loop
	-key presses

How many modules?
	-One for the game loop
	-One for drawing the board
	-One for creating the game logic
	-One for the snake class

Game loop
	-Begin the initial loop
	-Have a game clock
	-Update the current event
		-Either move forward
		-Change a legal direction (left or right)
		-Eat apple = grow
		-hit wall or tail = game over

Drawing game board
	-20x20 array
		-H = head
		-T = Tail
	-translate to pixels
	-Apples = Color red, placed randomly
	-Head,Tail = Color Green

Snake Class
	-Initialize
		-Start(length = 2)
		-One Head, one tail
		-For simplicity, place the snake in the same spot
			-Tail = (10,2), Head = (10,3)
		-Keep track of where the head is and where the tail is
	-Eat apple = grow
		-Now what does this mean?
			-So from the head, the tail increases from the one behind to the one at the very end
	-Move left or right
		-turn body
	-Check if hit self or wall
		-This would trigger game over
